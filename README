This is a proof-of-concept RESTful application that provides short hash for submitted url and vice versa.
Response to both types of requests is a UrlMapping class that contains both full url and hash.

API documentation (exposed endpoints, required parameters) is available at http://localhost:8080/mappings/swagger-ui/index.html#/

Application is written in Java 17, using Spring Boot 3.3.5. H2 in-memory database is used as storage, data is not preserved
between application launches and the database is empty upon launch (choice made due to the fact that it is POC)
